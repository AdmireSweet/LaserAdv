This project contains a combination of inherited and newly developed code.

Most of the training components of this project incorporate and extend prior work on robust audio adversarial examples, including:

- https://github.com/carlini/audio_adversarial_examples
- https://github.com/hiromu/robust_audio_ae

These components are distributed under the BSD 2-Clause License. In accordance with the terms of that license, the original copyright notice and license text are retained below without modification.

Other components of this project (e.g., SAE-TFI and evaluation utilities) were developed by the authors for the LaserAdv project and are released under the same BSD 2-Clause License for simplicity and compatibility.
